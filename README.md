# World Weather Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was learn how to utilize APIs to get information. We generated random latitude and longitude coordinates then used this data plus the OpenWeatherMap API to find nearby cities. From there, we used Google Maps API to generate heat maps based on weather as well as produce a mock itinerary.
